# Voyager Life Journey - Implementation Changes

## Phase 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- **Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml`**: Added 25+ dependencies (Hilt, Room+SQLCipher, Google Services, Navigation, WorkManager, etc.)
- **Updated `app/build.gradle.kts`**: Added plugins (Hilt, KAPT, Serialization), configured Room schema export, added all dependencies
- **Fixed `MainActivity.kt`**: Corrected syntax error, added temporary welcome text
- **Updated `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Added 12 permissions (location, foreground service, biometric, etc.), configured services and receivers

## Phase 2: Architecture & Database (Completed)
- **Created Clean Architecture structure**: 40+ folders organized by layer
- **Implemented domain models**: Location, Place, Visit, Geofence, Analytics models  
- **Setup Room database**: 4 entities, DAOs, TypeConverters, SQLCipher encryption
- **Created security utilities**: Encrypted SharedPreferences, secure passphrase generation
- **Setup Hilt DI**: Database, Repository, Location service modules

## Phase 3: Core Functionality & UI (Completed)
- **Implemented repository pattern**: LocationRepository, PlaceRepository, VisitRepository, GeofenceRepository, AnalyticsRepository
- **Created location tracking service**: Foreground service with FusedLocationProviderClient, battery optimization
- **Built permission handling**: Runtime location permissions with proper rationale system
- **Setup navigation**: Bottom navigation with 5 screens (Dashboard, Map, Timeline, Insights, Settings)
- **Enhanced MainActivity**: Added Hilt integration, permission management, navigation host
- **Created all basic screens**: Functional UI with Material 3 components
- **Dashboard screen**: Shows location stats, place counts, tracking toggle with ViewModel
- **Settings screen**: Privacy controls, data management, tracking settings
- **Fixed build system**: Resolved all compilation errors, successfully building APK

## Phase 4: Service Enhancement & Use Cases (Completed)
- **Enhanced LocationServiceManager**: Proper service status detection using ActivityManager, reactive StateFlow updates
- **Improved LocationTrackingService**: Location count tracking, notification updates, proper lifecycle management  
- **Created use cases layer**: LocationUseCases, PlaceUseCases, AnalyticsUseCases for business logic separation
- **LocationUseCases**: Location tracking controls, distance calculations, accuracy statistics, clustering support
- **PlaceUseCases**: Place detection from location clusters, categorization logic, place statistics calculation
- **AnalyticsUseCases**: Time analytics generation, movement pattern detection, day-by-day analysis
- **Enhanced DashboardViewModel**: Reactive service status observation, periodic refresh, proper state management

## Phase 5: Next Steps - Advanced Features
- Replace placeholder analytics with real calculations using new use cases
- Implement location clustering for place detection
- Build basic place categorization system  
- Add Google Places API integration for automatic place categorization
- Build Google Maps integration for map screen
- Create custom chart components using Canvas API
- Implement geofencing client for location-based alerts
- Implement biometric authentication for security
- Add data export/import functionality
