# Voyager Project Archive

This directory contains historical documents and session logs archived during the documentation cleanup of December 2025.

## Purpose

Files here are kept for historical reference and project retrospective. They document the evolution of Voyager from initial concept to production-ready state.

## Directory Structure

### /session-logs
Development session summaries organized by week.

- **week-1-2** - Initial implementation (Oct 2-24)
- **week-3-4** - Place detection foundation
- **week-5-6** - Review system, ML integration, detection improvements
- **week-7-8** - GPS optimization & power user features
- **week-9-10** - Testing & bug fixes
- **week-11-12** - Documentation consolidation (planned)

### /implementation-plans
Historical implementation plans and phase documentation.
- PROJECT_LOGBOOK.md - Development logbook
- PHASE_8_*.md - Phase 8 implementation docs
- PHASE_8_STATUS.txt - Phase 8 status report

### /ui-docs
UI documentation that was replaced by comprehensive guide (currently empty).

### /root-level-docs
Root-level documentation files that were consolidated into main docs.

**Analysis & Planning Documents:**
- SECURITY_ISSUES.md - Security analysis (now in VOYAGER_PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- CORE_FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md - Feature analysis (now in COMPREHENSIVE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)
- CRITICAL_BUGS_ANALYSIS.md - Bug analysis (now in PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - Project overview (now in VOYAGER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)
- CHANGES.md - Change history (now in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
- IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md - Improvement plans (now in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)

**Implementation Plans:**
- ACTIVITY_FIRST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Activity-first architecture (now in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 6)
- ACTIVITY_FIRST_QUICK_START.md - Quick start derivative doc
- LOCATION_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md - GPS quality plan (now in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 5)

**Architecture:**
- VOYAGER_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md - Old architecture guide (superseded by docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)

**Testing:**
- TEST_GUIDE.md - Test data insertion guide (content in docs/testing-guide.md)

## Why These Were Archived

### Session Logs (week-5-6, week-9-10)
- **Week 5-6**: Detection improvements, ML/UX status, place detection fixes
- **Week 9-10**: Bug fixes, testing status, critical fixes summaries
- Historical value only
- No longer needed for active development
- Kept for project retrospective

### Implementation Plans
- Specific to past development phases
- Content extracted and added to main documentation
- Superseded by IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

### Root-Level Docs
- Scattered across project root (organizational issue)
- All content verified and incorporated into main docs
- Archived after consolidation to maintain clean project structure

## Content Consolidation Summary

All critical content from archived files has been incorporated into active documentation:

✅ **Activity-First Plan** → docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (Phase 6)
✅ **Location Quality Improvements** → docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (Phase 5)
✅ **Security Issues** → docs/VOYAGER_PROJECT_STATUS.md
✅ **Bug Analysis** → docs/VOYAGER_PROJECT_STATUS.md, COMPREHENSIVE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md
✅ **Architecture** → docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md (more comprehensive)
✅ **Project Overview** → docs/VOYAGER_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
✅ **Testing Guides** → docs/testing-guide.md
